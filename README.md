# Screw Pad

## About

I once needed to drill into a rather large aluminium plate using a very small drill press. To do that, I needed to prop up the three corners of the plate that didn't fit on the drill press table. That's when the idea for the Screw Pad was born: A finely height-adjustable support for light workshop duties.

For a while, I planned to sell this as a product. Not because I though it would be successful. I have no indication that anyone ever needed this, except for me, that one time. But because it seemed like a simple enough product to design and manufacture (using a 3D printer), and I wanted to learn about the logistics of selling physical products online.

My product ideas have since taken [a different turn](https://github.com/hannobraun/notebook), so I decided to just make this repository public and leave it be.


## Status

This is usable, but a bit loose on my printer. The fit between the screw and nut could use some optimization.


## Ideas

I've had two main ideas for further evolution of this product.

### Rubber pads on the bottom

Add a recessed area to the bottom and glue some kind of rubber pad on there. I figured that this would increase traction. Although I haven't done testing to determine if this is actually needed.


### Sideways access using screw driver

During my testing, it became obvious that adjusting the Screw Pad was pretty difficult. The Screw Pad is pretty low, so if you put it under something, it can be hard to fit your hands in there to get to it.

I had this idea of using a worm gear mechanism to allow for adjusting the Screw Pad with a screw driver from the side. The problem with this is, that would take pretty long to adjust. And a worm gear is not backdrivable, so you can no longer just spin the top.

Maybe there's a decent idea in there somewhere. I don't know.


### Range extension through telescopic mechanism

Another problem is that the adjustable height range is relatively narrow. A factor of two is the upper limit for the ratio between the lengths of the fully contracted and the fully extended states.

I figured that maybe this could be addressed using a [multi-stage telescopic screw actuator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmyvMkfxtbo), but never got as far as designing that.
